## Dynamic Element Test
**CREATE THESE ELEMENTS WITH JQUERY**

#### Create a p tag and set the text to the value of 'data.safe_title'
- have appear underneath the h1 you made earlier

#### Create another p tag and set this text to display "comic  number " with data.num in the text of the p tag

- give your image a border
- give your border a color
- change the text color of the p tags so that they are all the same


#### Create a button in your index.html
- call this button navi
- When the button is clicked have it alert the user 'hey are you listening?'

#### Create a button in your index.html

#### See if you can write a function to change the comic when the page is loaded.

#### Add a CSS framework to your page
- don't forget to put the CDN in the right place
